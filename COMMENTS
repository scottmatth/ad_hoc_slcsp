Ensure Python3 and Pip are installed
If not, install them
Ensure venv is available for python (it should if you are using a version above 3.3)

create a new Virtual environment
python3 -m venv [Name of virtual environment]

activate the environment
source [Name of virtual environment]/bin/activate

perform pip installs
* python3 -m pip install ".[dependencies]"

run unit tests to ensure things are running
* pytest

execute python scripts

* cd src/slcsp
* python3 slcsp.py
** This is the basic version using just loading and interpreting the CSV to derive the solution
* python3 slcsp_with_pandas.py
** Judging by what type of work is done at Ad Hoc, it seemed likely Pandas was used,
** so I implemented a solution with pandas.  The unit tests covers these methods
